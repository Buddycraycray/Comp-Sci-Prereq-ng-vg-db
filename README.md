# Comp-Sci-Prereq-ng-vg-db

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

The code comes from the online channel freecodecamp. I modified the markup and code to better understand and learn the Angular Framework with Typescript and calling Public APIs.

This is a project that uses an API to pull info on video games. The user can search up a video game and learn more about it.

## Development server

To use, you need npm and ng.
Run `npm install` to download the needed node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
